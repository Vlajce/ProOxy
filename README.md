## ProOxy – Air Quality Mobile App (Frontend)

A React Native mobile application developed as part of an internship at IT-Centar, focusing on air quality awareness. 
The app provides a clean, intuitive interface for users to view air pollution levels, track environmental data, and access relevant alerts or recommendations.

Designed exclusively as a frontend project, it demonstrates proficiency in React Native, mobile UI design, and responsive layouts for real-time environmental monitoring.
